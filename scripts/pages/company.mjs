    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> this policy applies to championroofingok.com, operated by ${BIZ.legalName}, ${BIZ.street}, ${BIZ.city}, ${BIZ.state} ${BIZ.zip}.</p>

    <h2>What we collect</h2>
    <p>When you submit a form on this site, we collect the information you choose to put into it: your name, phone number, email address, the service you are interested in, your property address or city, and whatever details you write in the message field.</p>
    <p>We do not ask for and do not want financial information, social security numbers, or any other sensitive identifiers through this website.</p>

    <h2>Why we collect it</h2>
    <p>To respond to your request. That is the whole purpose. We use your contact details to get back to you about a roof assessment, a quote, or whatever else you contacted us about, and we use the property details so the inspector arrives at the right place knowing what they are looking at.</p>

    <h2>What we do not do with it</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not sell your information.</li>
      <li>We do not rent or trade it to third parties for their marketing.</li>
      <li>Mobile phone numbers and text messaging consent are never shared with third parties or affiliates for marketing or promotional purposes.</li>
      <li>We do not add you to unrelated mailing lists because you asked about a roof.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who else sees it</h2>
    <p>Form submissions on this site are delivered by a third party form handling service, which processes the message in order to email it to us. Our own staff see it in order to respond to you. Where your enquiry involves an insurance claim, relevant details may be shared with your carrier or adjuster as part of handling that claim, with your knowledge.</p>

    <h2>Cookies and analytics</h2>
    <p>This site may use analytics to understand which pages people find useful. That data is aggregated and is not used to identify you personally.</p>

    <h2>Text messages</h2>
    <p>If you opt in to text messages from us, that is covered separately. See our <a href="/sms-terms">SMS terms</a> and <a href="/sms-privacy-policy">SMS privacy policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Your choices</h2>
    <p>You can ask us to delete the information you have sent us, or to stop contacting you, at any time. Email <a href="mailto:${BIZ.email}">${BIZ.email}</a> or call <a href="tel:${BIZ.phoneRaw}">${BIZ.phone}</a> and we will take care of it.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>If this policy changes we will update this page. Material changes will be reflected in the date at the top.</p>
